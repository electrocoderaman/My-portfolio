I'm Aman,
 and I'm currently grinding through my first year of Electrical Engineering. On the side, I love to build stuff for the web, and this site is where I'm putting all my work.

What I Packed Into It
It Works Everywhere: I made sure this site looks good no matter what you're using. Pull it up on your phone, your laptop, a giant monitor—it'll be clean.

Some Cool Tricks: I didn't want it to be boring, so I added some interactive stuff. There's a typing animation on the homepage, a hamburger menu for mobile, and some animations that kick in as you scroll.

Particle Background: I threw in a neat little particle animation in the background to give it some life.

Smooth Scrolling: When you click the links in the navigation, it'll just glide you down the page. Nice and smooth.

A Way to Reach Me: I put a contact form in there so you can easily send me a message.

The Tech I Used
I kept it pretty straightforward with the basics:

HTML: To build the structure of the site.

CSS: For all the styling and making it look good. I used CSS variables to make it easy to change colors and stuff later.

JavaScript: To handle all the interactive parts, like the animations and the menu.

How the Files are Laid Out
If you want to check out the code, here’s where everything is:

└── media/

How to See It Live
It's super simple. Just download the files and open the index.html file in your browser. That's it, you're good to go.
